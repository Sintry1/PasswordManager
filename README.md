# PasswordManager
Small React/Node project built as a password manager.

To run the project, clone the whole repository to your machine and navigate to it using your IDE.

Open a terminal (or two) and navigate to the client folder and run the command npm install.

Do the same for the server folder to install all of the dependencies.

Once done, in both terminals write 'npm start'. I would suggest starting the server first. You should see a message saying "Server is running" if done correctly.

This project runs nodemon to restart the server, so any accidental changes in the EncryptionHandler.js or index.js in the server will reload the server (even adding a whitespace character).
